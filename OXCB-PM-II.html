					  <h11>Pregabalin and methylcobalamin in NP</h11><br>
						<h11b>Pregabalin in NP</h11b>
                      
					  <p>Pregabalin is a first-line drug for the treatment of
NP and is effective in both peripheral and central
NP.<sup><a href="OXCB-PM-IV.html">1</a></sup> Pregabalin significantly reduces pain as early
as the first week of treatment with beneficial effects
on sleep and mood disturbances. A Cochrane metaanalysis
showed that pregabalin is effective in treating
NP and fibromyalgia.<sup><a href="OXCB-PM-IV.html">3</a></sup> The American Association of
Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine, the
American Academy of Neurology, and the American
Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation
guidelines report that pregabalin is effective and
recommend it for the treatment of painful diabetic
neuropathy.<sup><a href="OXCB-PM-IV.html">4</a></sup> However, pregabalin has a short halflife,
and therefore needs frequent administration.
This limitation of pregabalin might reduce patient
compliance, particularly when used as a long-term
therapy. Hence, a sustained-release formulation of
pregabalin may be a good option.<sup><a href="OXCB-PM-IV.html">1</a></sup></p><img src="images/blog08.gif"/>

<h11b>Methylcobalamin in NP</h11b>
                      
						<p>The myelin sheath insulates nerves and helps in the
proper and rapid conduction of impulses. Vitamin
B12 deficiency can damage the myelin sheath.<sup><a href="OXCB-PM-IV.html">1</a></sup> A
study showed that methylcobalamin, the neurological
active form of vitamin B12, significantly improves
somatic and autonomic symptoms in patients with
diabetic neuropathy when compared to placebo.<sup><a href="OXCB-PM-IV.html">5</a></sup>
A systematic review of clinical controlled trials
concluded that methylcobalamin has beneficial effects
on autonomic symptoms, somatosensory symptoms,
and pain.<sup><a href="OXCB-PM-IV.html">6</a></sup> Chronic use of metformin, a first-line drug
for diabetes mellitus, causes vitamin B12 deficiency
and thereby aggravates neuropathy in patients with
type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methylcobalamin helps
regenerate the myelin sheath and restores nerve
function. Hence, the addition of pregabalin to
methylcobalamin may help in relieving pain.<sup><a href="OXCB-PM-IV.html">1</a></sup></p>

<h11b>Combination of pregabalin and
methylcobalamin in NP</h11b>
                      
					  <p>Pregabalin and methylcobalamin are both capable of
relieving the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy (PN).
Prabhoo et al. reported that a fixed dose combination
of methylcobalamin and pregabalin is well-tolerated
and efficacious in NP.<sup><a href="OXCB-PM-IV.html">7</a></sup> Additionally, 87% doctors and 88.11% patients expressed response to therapy
as good to excellent. A fixed dose combination of
pregabalin immediate release and methylcobalamin
was evaluated in the PRECISE (PREgabalin sustained
release Combination In Several Endpoints) study.<sup><a href="OXCB-PM-IV.html">2</a></sup>
It was found that the fixed dose combination of
pregabalin immediate release and methylcobalamin
was effective and well-tolerated in Indian patients
with various neuropathies and orthopedic conditions.</p><img src="images/blog09.gif"/>

<h11b>Combination of pregabalin and methylcobalamin
significantly reduced NP in Indian patients<sup><a href="OXCB-PM-IV.html">1</a></sup></h11b>
                      
						<p>The PRECISE II study assessed the efficacy and
safety of fixed dose combination of sustained-release
pregabalin and immediate release methylcobalamin in
Indian patients in reducing NP in real-life situations.
In PRECISE II, a prospective, multicenter, openlabelled,
single-arm, observational, 14-day study,
patients with PN received sustained-release pregabalin
75 mg or 150 mg combined with methylcobalamin
1500 mg immediate release. Pregabalin 75 mg/day was
the most commonly prescribed dosage for sustainedrelease
pregabalin and methylcobalamin, contrary
to the dose range recommended for pregabalin
(150–600 mg/day). The study results were:</p>



 <ul>
                            <li><strong><i>Sustained-release pregabalin and
methylcobalamin significantly reduced pain</i></strong>
                              <p>Sustained-release pregabalin and methylcobalamin
significantly reduced the 10-point visual analog
scale (VAS) score for pain as early as the first week
of treatment. Sustained-release pregabalin and
methylcobalamin significantly improved pain within
1 week (p<0.05), which continued further over the
2-week period (p<0.05, Table 1). A 72.3% reduction
in VAS score for pain was noted within a short span
of 2 weeks.</p></li><img src="images/Table_07.gif"/>
                            <li><strong><i>Sustained-release pregabalin and
methylcobalamin improved positive and
negative symptoms of PN</i></strong> <p>Sustained-release pregabalin and methylcobalamin
significantly improved (p<0.05) negative and
positive symptoms of PN (Table 2). Improvements were
consistent irrespective of the cause of neuropathy According to the global assessment of efficacy,
97% of patients and 99% of investigators rated
combination of sustained-release pregabalin and
methylcobalamin as good to excellent. Similarly,
99% of patients and investigators reported good to
excellent tolerability.</p><img src="images/Table_08.gif"/>
</li>
                             <li><strong><i>Adverse effects of sustained-release pregabalin
and methylcobalamin</i></strong> <p>Giddiness (4.7%), sedation (3.6%), dizziness (2.9%),
drowsiness (2.3%), and nausea (2.3%) were the
most common adverse effects. Except giddiness, all
adverse effects were mild to moderate. In the
PRECISE II study, the incidence of adverse effects
such as giddiness (38.50% <i>vs. </i>3.6%) and sedation
(36.73% <i>vs.</i> 4.7%) were lower when compared with
the PRECISE study. This lower incidence of adverse
effects can be attributed to the sustained release
formulation and the lower dose of pregabalin used in
most patients in the PRECISE II study.</p>

<p>Dongre et al. concluded that sustained-release
pregabalin and methylcobalamin significantly
reduces NP with improvement in both positive and
negative symptoms associated with neuropathy, in
Indian patients.</p>
